# Babet's Site

This website was created to store and share my projects.

## Why I Built This 
This project is more than just a collection of notes. It's an opportunity for me to:
- Deepen my understanding: By actively engaging with the course content through website creation, I aim to solidify my knowledge of biomechanics principles.
- Practice explaining the material: Translating complex concepts into clear and concise website content will help me refine my understanding and ability to explain these principles to others.
- Mentally organize the material: Structuring and presenting the course information in a logical and organized manner on this website will help me develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between different concepts.
- 
## What You'll Find Here
Expect to find resources including:
- Lecture Notes & Summaries: My own interpretations and summaries of key concepts.
- External Resources: Links to relevant articles, videos, and online tools.
- Personal Reflections: My own insights and observations on the course material.
