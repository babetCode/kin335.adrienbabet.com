## Deformation of tissue

## Loading on tissue

- Axial
    - compression
    - tension
- Shear
    - also along one axis, but in opposite directions (and missaligned)

- Multi-axial
    - bening
    - torsion *why?*

*ACL is less taut with knee flexion*

**Stress:** force per unit area. Area is measured over plane normal to force vector.

**Strain:** change in dimension/shape.

how does young's modulus differ from slope?

**Comminuted:** *Medicine* (of a fracture) producing multiple bone splinters.

*Why can tissue withstand more strain than it's maximum load before fracture?*
